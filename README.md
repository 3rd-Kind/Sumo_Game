# Sumo_Game
A rough Sumo Game Made in 2024

The premise of the game is to eat as many burgers, fries, hotdogs, pizzas & soda's in order to increase weight.
The end goal of the game is to have the largest weight prossible.
- Player has 3 lives.
- The more weight increases the more speed decreases.
- Rotten foods are peppers, steak & tomato, these will make your character lose weight, even when weight decreases speed won't increase again.
- Pufferfish will take lives if made contact with.
- Enemy sumo's will make player bounce of them and player will consequently lose weight.

Current unresolved bugs. 
- Main menu music will keep layering over eachother when the main menu is activated.
- Space bar causes the game to reset.
- When the high score shows the player rect and the weight stays on the screen.
- I initially wanted to store the top 10 scores but due to limited knowledge, i was unable so currently the top weight is displayed.
